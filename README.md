# School District Summary Analysis

## Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze the standardized test results of a school district as well as information about their respective schools in order to showcase possible trends in school performance.

## Outline

### District Summary

A summary of the district info was created in a pandas data frame called "district_summary" to showcase:
* Total Schools
* Total Students
* Total Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* Percent of Students Passing Math 
* Percent of Students Passing Reading 
* Percent Overall Passing Math and Reading

### School Summary

A summary of the each school within the district info was created in a pandas data frame called "school_summary" to showcase:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* Percent of Students Passing Math 
* Percent of Students Passing Reading 
* Percent Overall Passing Math and Reading

### Top Performing Schools 

A pandas data frame was created of the top 5 schools by percent overall passing called "top_schools " which included:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* Percent of Students Passing Math 
* Percent of Students Passing Reading 
* Percent Overall Passing Math and Reading

### Bottom Performing Schools

A pandas data frame was created of the bottom 5 performing schools by percent overall passing called "bottom_schools " which included:

* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* Percent of Students Passing Math 
* Percent of Students Passing Reading 
* Percent Overall Passing Math and Reading

### Math Scores by Grade

A pandas data frame was created to showcase math scores by grade

### Scores by School Spending

Spending bins were created and the following information shown
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* Percent of Students Passing Math 
* Percent of Students Passing Reading 
* Percent Overall Passing Math and Reading

### Scores by School Size

* Bins of school size were created and the following information shown:
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* Percent of Students Passing Math 
* Percent of Students Passing Reading 
* Percent Overall Passing Math and Reading

![Scores by School Size](https://github.com/chrischristensen21/School-District-Data-Summary-Using-Pandas/blob/main/PyCitySchools/Screen%20Shots/Score%20by%20School%20Size.png)

### Scores by School Type

* School type (Charter vs Public) was separated and the following information was shown:
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* Percent of Students Passing Math 
* Percent of Students Passing Reading 
* Percent Overall Passing Math and Reading

![Scores by School Type](https://github.com/chrischristensen21/School-District-Data-Summary-Using-Pandas/blob/main/PyCitySchools/Screen%20Shots/Scores%20by%20School%20Type.png)

### Conclusions

A few things that stand out upon a quick observation is that school spending did not increase students scores. The school type and class size had a larger impact. Charter schools appeared to perform better as well as smaller class room sizes.
